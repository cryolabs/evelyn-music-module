## About

This repository contains the old music system used for Evelyn powered by erela.js. As erela.js has been officially discontinued, Evelyn has moved onto using Kazagumo/Shoukaku for her music system. Since then, this system has entered legacy mode and will no longer receive updates or any sort of support from me.

## Features

- Full YouTube, Spotify, Deezer, SoundCloud and Apple Music support
- Dynamic queue system
